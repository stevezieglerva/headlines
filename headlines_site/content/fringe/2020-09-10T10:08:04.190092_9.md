<p>Let's all make Dr. Paul Alexander A STAR. No, he's not the good kind of STAR.

	Oh thanks for this inner tab, Politico: Half a million kids have caught coronavirus in the US and more than a hundred have died and we have absolutely no idea what the effects of it will be later in life even if they don't get sick now, so PLEASE SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT 'KIDS DON'T GET IT,' REPUBLICAN ASSHOLES. <a href="https://services.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-state-level-data-report/" target="_blank">(American Academy of Pediatrics)</a>

	I know the Lincoln Project is there to do our dirty work, and we libs are all a bit precious about being too fair. HOWEVER. I categorically reject likening anyone, including Lindsey Graham, to a parasite: 
</p><blockquote>[S]tomach-churning images of maggots, animals decaying, and bugs feeding on flesh. <br/><br/>And then there's Senator Lindsay Graham (R-SC).


	"Some animals can't survive unless they take," says the ad's narrator. "They don't establish natural equilibriums. Some animals are parasitic. They drink the lifeblood of their host, infect whatever they touch and spread like a virus. They're often right under our noses, camouflaged, convincing their hosts they're not harmful at all."
</blockquote><p>
	Insisting people are parasites is how you get the Holocaust and Rwanda, and I'm not going to giggle and call it naughty. — <a href="https://www.towleroad.com/2020/09/parasite-lindsay-graham/?fbclid=IwAR3sDsYgEfHwYlEpfWXBTYhbnEvJ299IENaYvYVnd2teRvAtAjAawNhI4hw" target="_blank">Towleroad</a>
</p><p>Should you buy Josh Powell's book about how he was the only good man at the NRA, it's those other ones who are bloodthirsty hoors?<br/></p><blockquote>
	This is a sad book, and a bad one, and you shouldn't buy it. The thinking in it is poor; the writing is worse. The author "exposes" evils that, if you've been paying even scant attention, you already know. Expect it soon in a Walmart remainder bin near you.<br/>
<br/>
	To summarize my argument thus far: No.<br/>
